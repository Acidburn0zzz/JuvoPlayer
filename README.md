JuvoPlayer
=======
The reference for developers of streaming live TV and VOD Tizen .Net applications. The GUIs (alternative) are built on XamarinForms framework and Tizen Native with OpenGL or React Native. This sample illustrates how to utilize the elementary streams data source API (demuxed audio and video). The DRMed (MS PlayReady by CENC interface) and clean content can be played. MPEG DASH and RTP/RTSP content delivery protocols clients are integrated with the app (no TV platform dependency). The HLS protocol and demuxing of the streams are handled by the FFMPEG library incorporated as .so binaries.

## Dependencies
1. [FFmpeg 3.3.6 'Hilbert'][ffmpeglink] - library (binaries) acting:

   [ffmpeglink]:https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_3.3
   
 * HLS protocol scenario's downloader and demuxer
 * RTP/RTSP protocol based scenario's demuxer. 
 * MPEG DASH protocol based scenario's demuxer.  
2. [https://github.com/ngraziano/SharpRTSP][rtsplink] . (RTSP module, 23rd December 2018) - RTP/RTSP protocol scenarios downloader

  [rtsplink]: https://github.com/ngraziano/SharpRTSP
  
3. Samsung Tizen TV firmware for 2019, 2020 TVs, including the Tizen 5.x TV emulator distributed with the Tizen Studio SDK 3.7 and newer.
4. Video content URLs embedded in videoclips.json files. See in the project tree:
* _Resources\videoclips.json_

5. React Native Tizen (https://github.com/Samsung/react-native-tizen-dotnet) based on react-native 0.42 and react-native-windows 0.42.
   * Nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
   * Yarn - https://yarnpkg.com/en/
   
   Important
   > The Nodejs versions higher than 12.10 were affected by regular expression issue (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/26598) which impacts the React Native Tizen dependencies update (npm or yarn command). If it happens in Your case try downgrade Nodejs to version 12.10.

## Setup instructions
1. Download .zip or clone the repository to Your local drive. 
2. Open the JuvoPlayer solution with Microsoft Visual Studio. See the articles regarding Tizen .Net TV environment setup here: [https://developer.samsung.com/tv/tizen-net-tv][tizendotnettvlink]

[tizendotnettvlink]: https://developer.samsung.com/tv/tizen-net-tv 

3. Setup the nuget packages repository for the solution (restore NuGet packages)
4. Set one of the GUI projects as startup. Choose one of the following:
* XamarinPlayer
* JuvoPlayer.OpenGL
* JuvoReactNative
* SimplePlayer

##### Important
> Due to it's 'hybrid' nature, The JuvoReactNative projects requires additional step. Before the first build or any JS part modifications it needs creation of the bundles to be included in the Tizen .NET shared\res folder. See the 'React Native bundle preparation' for details. 
    
### React Native bundle preparation
* Make sure Nodejs and Yarn have been successfully installed in Your system.
* Go to the JuvoReactNative root directory in the command line window.
* Type the `yarn` command without any parameters. Wait until all the dependencies have been installed.
* Release mode
  - Type: `yarn bundle`
  - Go and delete the JuvoReactNative\Tizen\shared\res\assets\assets folder which is redundant (React Native Tizen bundle script issue: https://github.com/Samsung/react-native-tizen-dotnet/issues/30#issue-533804121)
  - Build the JuvoReactNative with MS Visual Studio.
* Debug mode   
  - Follow the 'Release mode' instructions but replace the first step with:  `yarn bundle --dev` command.

## Application launch 

1. Connect with a TV set (or emulator) using the Device Manager tool (member of SDK) installed together with the Tizen Tools (SDK) see more in [https://developer.samsung.com/tv/tizen-net-tv][tizendotnettvlink]
2. Start the select in Visual Studio solution tree GUI project by pressing F5 (debug) or ctrl+F5 (release). The app requires Partner Level privilege generated with the Certificate Manager tool (member of SDK). Before the first launch please, make sure that you have created one and have sent it by 'Permit to install' command using the Device Manager tool.

##### Important
> Every physical Tizen TV device needs a set of electronic signatures (keys) for successful launching of the Tizen .Net apps. To get the keys a developer has to contact Samsung Content Manager (CM) person in his country of residence. The https://seller.samsungapps.com/tv/ site can be used to facilitate this step for all interested business partners. As soon as the CM agrees to the contract details and confirms the company's 'Partner' status, the signatures will be shared by Samsung R&D over the seller.samsung.com site. This step is mandatory since the JuvoPlayer uses sensitive API's (native binaries and DRM access). There is no need to make such a request in case of launching the JuvoPlayer on the Tizen TV emulator. 

#### Tizen TV Emulator 2019, 2020 (Tizen 5.x) 
 
  > 1. All JuvoPlayer based applications contain complementary native binaries for ARM and x86. They are located in subfolders with the appropriate names (lib\x86, lib\arm).
  > 2. The consequence of selecting the clean video in resolutions higher than 640Ã—480 (VGA) is significant playback smoothness degradation. The reason of this is limited performance of the TV emulator. This drawback does not appear on the physical TV set units.
  > 3. The Tizen TV emulator does not playback any DRM'ed contents (PlayReady, Widevine).

## Debugging

### Logger UDP
The JuvoLogger.Udp allows JuvoPlayer log capture, via UDP, from devices which do not provide access to console logging. Usage of UDP logger does require application repacking after modification of the logger.config file. This can be done using the MS Visual Studio's 'Rebuild' option. 
Editing in source code tree, logger.config is located in:
  * <application_root>/XamarinPlayer/XamarinPlayer.Tizen.TV/res
  * <application_root>/JuvoPlayer.OpenGL/res
  * <application_root>/JuvoReactNative/Tizen/res

To make the logger work follow the steps:
1. Enable UDP logging by adding the listening port value to config file. Port# defines listening port (example port: 2222) to which client can "connect to"
```javascript
  JuvoPlayer=Info
  UdpPort=<Port#>  
  ```
2. Start application or build and launch
3. In order to connect to device, use any UDP client software, like netcat (https://nmap.org/ncat/). 

4. Connect to JuvoPlayer typing with Your PC CLI and confirm by enter key:
```javascript
  ncat -u <IP of device> <Port>
  ```
>  
> Upon connection, send any data to JuvoPlayer to "connect to" logging service. If everything is working fine, following information should be received by the client: 
> 
 ```javascript
    ****************************
    *   JuvoPlayer UDP logger  *
    *                          * 
    * 1 UDP packet to:         *
    *   - stop output          *
    *     logs will be dropped *
    *   - start output         *
    *   - hijack connection    *
    ****************************
    *         Started          *
    ****************************
  ```
> Hint
> 
>  It happens that on Windows 10 (ncat), more than just one 'enter' click is needed to see the log messages on the screen. Please, try to confirm connection several times if it fails at first.

### React Native Tizen .Net Live coding  
> It is possible to launch and work on the JuvoReactNative GUI using facebook 'hot module reloading' engine (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html). To configure it follow the below guide:

#### TV emulator
  1. Launch Tizen TV emulator. 
  2. Set the port redirection in 'Emulator control panel->Network' menu: 
     * Source (Local host) port = 9998 (can be any free value but the same as in the "config"->"tvip" port)
     * to destination  (10.0.2.15) port = 8081 (npm server port)

  ##### Important
  > Step 2. needs to be repeated every time the TV emulator reboots.

  3. Edit package.json in the application root folder writing: 
  ```javascript
  "config": {
    "tvip": "127.0.0.1:9998",
    "mode": "Debug"
  },
  ```
  4. Type `yarn bundle --dev` command from the JuvoReactNative folder level.
  5. Delete the redundant assets folder (see the 'Setup instructions' section).
  6. Switch to 'Debug' build mode of Tizen .NET project (here it is named JuvoReactNative).
  7. Start build (using MS Visual Studio)
  8. Type command `npm run server`
  9. Launch the application. You may use PC ctrl+F5 keys in MS Visual Studio or TV remote control keys. The latter case does make sense only in the TV set or TV emulator menu if the former (PC) launching have happened at least once.
  10. Press 'red' button on the remote control to open the configuration menu. Select (one by one) the 'Enable hot module reloading', 'Enable live reload', 'Set host ip' (enter the IP address of Your host PC) and 'Reload JavaScript' options. Each option selection closes the menu, so You need to reopen it with the 'red' button on the remote controller per option.  

  > There is one more item: 'Start JS Remote debugging' with Chrome on the host PC. Selecting it from the menu triggers the application's button press event, so working with it may be confusing. 

From now on You can modify JavaScript part of the application code and see the update result right after saving it on the PC.

#### TV set unit
1. Switch on the TV set
2. Edit package.json in the application root folder writing: 
  ```javascript
  "config": {
    "tvip": "192.168.137.4",  
    "mode": "Debug"
  },
//The "tvip": "192.168.137.4" needs to be replaced with the actual IP address of the developer's TV set.
  ```
3. Includes all the steps from 4. to 10. described previously in the 'Launch TV emulator' section.
